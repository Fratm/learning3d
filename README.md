I am learning to write 3d games in Godot 3.1, following the Kids Can Code YouTube channel.
The first video in the series is here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ7soQ-N-eQ
Some assets are from Kenney (https://kenney.nl/) and are free to use.

You can download this code, and use, edit, delete whatever all you want.  Be be warned, this is a learning project, it may or may not destroy your system, your neighborhood, the entire world, and/or the universe,  who knows..  In other words, use at your own risk.

Questions?  e-mail fratm@fratm.com  or join my discord https://www.fratm.com/discord or @IamFratm on the twitters.
